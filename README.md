Using a modified MelonLoader without some security features brings a risk with it, you should read Knah's blogpost: [Malicious Mods and you](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/edit/master/Malicious-Mods.md)

Don't blame me or other when you data or tokens get stolen. Always think about what mods you are using and why they are obfuscated and so on. 

Don't hatespeech the original Author please, without them this would not be possible!

## Building

To Build simply
1. Clone repo using git
2. Copy `*.dlls` from `MelonLoader\Managed` to `Libs` folder
3. Copy in `MelonLoader.dll`,`ActionMenuApi.dll` and `UIExpansionKit.dll` too
4. Build Solution

## ActionMenuApi

This mod doesn't do anything on it's own. <br>
It provides an easy way for modders to add integration with the action menu. <br>
It supports the use of the <br>
* Radial Puppet
* Four Axis Puppet
* Button
* Toggle Button
* Sub Menus

Additionally allows mods to add their menus to a dedicated section on the action menu to prevent clutter. <br>
More information [here](https://github.com/gompocp/ActionMenuApi)

## ActionMenuUtils 
- Lets you respawn using the action menu<br>
- Lets you go home for when respawning wont save you such as in broken worlds with no floor<br>
- Additionally lets you reset avatar or rejoin instance<br>
- Shows an example of how you might use my action menu api thingy :) more info available [here](https://github.com/gompocp/ActionMenuApi/) <br>

## DownloadFix

> The bug this mod aimed at helping with has now been patch in Build 1106+. Therefore there's no reason to use this mod anymore :) 

- Yeah its literally a one line fix for the loading bug  <br>
- Adds a button to the UIX settings page and to the world loading screen <br>
- Don't really know what else to say about it so yeah <br>

## WorldPredownload<br>
- Credit to [Psychloor](https://github.com/Psychloor/AdvancedInvites/blob/master/AdvancedInvites/InviteHandler.cs) for method to convert worldID to apiWorld instance + much much more, and some of the way stuff is structured is also inspired by his utilities file
- Credit to [Ben](https://github.com/BenjaminZehowlt/DynamicBonesSafety) for xref scanning mechanism and hud icon idea
- Credit to [Knah](https://github.com/knah/) for [Enable Listener](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/blob/master/UIExpansionKit/Components/EnableDisableListener.cs) and the [hud icon method](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/blob/master/JoinNotifier/JoinNotifierMod.cs#L120) that I changed to use here along with the [assetbundle loading mechanism](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/blob/master/JoinNotifier/JoinNotifierMod.cs#L61)
- fwenny for helping with some testing 
- You can hit preload on an invite, on a world page or on a friend user page
- You can see your download status bottom right of quick menu 
- Currently you can only download/preload one world at a time 
- If you go to another world while downloading, it'll cancel the download 
- Performance may degrade for split second on world enter due to you having a large cache size
